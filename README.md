# 0/1 Knapsack Problem Using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)

This project explores the application of **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)** to solve the **0/1 Knapsack Problem**, comparing its performance with the classical **Dynamic Programming (DP)** approach.

## ðŸš€ Abstract

The 0/1 Knapsack Problem is a classic NP-hard combinatorial optimization challenge where a subset of items, each with a weight and value, must be chosen to maximize total value under a weight constraint. 

In this project, we implement:
- An **exact** method using **Dynamic Programming (DP)**.
- An **approximate**, metaheuristic method using **Binary PSO**, adapted with greedy initialization, repair mechanisms, and adaptive thresholds.

The PSO approach yields near-optimal solutions significantly faster for large input sizes, with average error mostly under **5%**, validating its practical value for scalability.
